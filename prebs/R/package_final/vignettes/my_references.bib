  abstract = {Genome-wide expression profiling is a powerful tool for implicating
	novel gene ensembles in cellular mechanisms of health and disease.
	The most popular platform for genome-wide expression profiling is
	the Affymetrix GeneChip. However, its selection of probes relied
	on earlier genome and transcriptome annotation which is significantly
	different from current knowledge. The resultant informatics problems
	have a profound impact on analysis and interpretation the data. Here,
	we address these critical issues and offer a solution. We identified
	several classes of problems at the individual probe level in the
	existing annotation, under the assumption that current genome and
	transcriptome databases are more accurate than those used for GeneChip
	design. We then reorganized probes on more than a dozen popular GeneChips
	into gene-, transcript- and exon-specific probe sets in light of
	up-to-date genome, cDNA/EST clustering and single nucleotide polymorphism
	information. Comparing analysis results between the original and
	the redefined probe sets reveals approximately 30-50\% discrepancy
	in the genes previously identified as differentially expressed, regardless
	of analysis method. Our results demonstrate that the original Affymetrix
	probe set definitions are inaccurate, and many conclusions derived
	from past GeneChip analyses may be significantly flawed. It will
	be beneficial to re-analyze existing GeneChip data with updated probe
	set definitions.},

  abstract = {A new protocol for sequencing the messenger RNA in a cell, known as
	RNA-Seq, generates millions of short sequence fragments in a single
	run. These fragments, or 'reads', can be used to measure levels of
	gene expression and to identify novel splice variants of genes. However,
	current software for aligning RNA-Seq data to a genome relies on
	known splice junctions and cannot identify novel ones. TopHat is
	an efficient read-mapping algorithm designed to align reads from
	an RNA-Seq experiment to a reference genome without relying on known
	splice sites.We mapped the RNA-Seq reads from a recent mammalian
	RNA-Seq experiment and recovered more than 72\% of the splice junctions
	reported by the annotation-based software from that study, along
	with nearly 20,000 previously unreported junctions. The TopHat pipeline
	is much faster than previous systems, mapping nearly 2.2 million
	reads per CPU hour, which is sufficient to process an entire RNA-Seq
	experiment in less than a day on a standard desktop computer. We
	describe several challenges unique to ab initio splice site discovery
	from RNA-Seq reads that will require further algorithm development.TopHat
	is free, open-source software available from http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu.Supplementary
	data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {In this paper we report exploratory analyses of high-density oligonucleotide
	array data from the Affymetrix GeneChip system with the objective
	of improving upon currently used measures of gene expression. Our
	analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study
	consisting of five MGU74A mouse GeneChip arrays, part of the data
	from an extensive spike-in study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's
	Genetics Institute involving 95 HG-U95A human GeneChip arrays; and
	part of a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG-U95A
	GeneChip arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect
	match and mismatch probe (PM and MM) values of these data, and examine
	the variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes
	believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain
	why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level
	intensities. We then examine the behavior of the PM and MM using
	spike-in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's
	(i) average difference (AvDiff) and (ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and (iii)
	the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index (MBEI).
	The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a
	new summary measure that is a robust multi-array average (RMA) of
	background-adjusted, normalized, and log-transformed PM values. We
	evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution
	study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and
	(for MBEI and RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms
	in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential
	expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no
	obvious downside to using RMA and attaching a standard error (SE)
	to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific
	affinities.},

	The package is currently in its second release, affy provides the
	user with extreme flexibility when carrying out an analysis and make
	it possible to access and manipulate probe intensity data. In this
